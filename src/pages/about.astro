		<!-- <p>Here are some of my projects and experiences</p> -->
		<!-- <ul class="list-disc list-inside"> -->
		<!-- 	<li><a href="https://github.com/green726/SWO">SWO</a> - my compiled programming language built in c# and LLVM with a custom-made parser</li> -->
		<!-- 	<li>Programming team lead - First Robotics <a href="https://github.com/CSHCyberhawks">CSHCyberhawks</a><br> -->
		<!-- 	&emsp; I built a custom swerve drive train complete with no-accelerometer odometry, PIDs, field orientation, and a self-correcting motion-profiled autonomous mode.</li> -->
		<!-- 	<li>The Fig Office - My submission to the week long 2022.2 Brackey's game jam. <br> -->
		<!-- 	&emsp; In this game, I created a full custom 3d character controller, AI behavior system, and dialogue system. I also did all of the game, level, and UI design. The artwork was all free assets. -->
 	<!-- 		<br> <a href="The Fig Office">Github</a> <a href = "https://green726.itch.io/the-fig-office">Itch.io</a> -->
		<!-- 	</li> -->
		<!-- 	<li>Haywire - My submission to the week long 2021.2 Brackey's game jam. <br> -->
		<!-- 	&emsp; For this game, I wrote a custom parkour 3d character controller complete with wall running and sliding, as well as a custom powerup system. For this game, I split the game and level design 50/50 with my artist and did all of the UI design. -->

		<!-- 	</li> -->
		<!-- 	<li><a href = "https://github.com/green726/greenvim">Greenvim</a> - my neovim configuration and my main IDE. <br> -->
		<!-- 	&emsp; Greenvim has a minimalistic look, but has as many features as most IDEs.  -->
		<!-- 	</li> -->
		<!-- 	<li><a href="https://github.com/AstrocoreGames">Astrocore Games</a><br> -->
		<!-- 	&emsp; I built a full backend for the Astrocore Games website (sign in, account information, etc) with vanilla JS, socket.io, and express.js. As well as some HTML games. </li> -->
